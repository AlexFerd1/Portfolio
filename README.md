This Git repository is my documentation for the portfolio website that I am buildiing from scratch. The purpose of this portfolio is basically a digital resume, 
with all the projects I've done and the skills ive aquiired over the years of programming 
skills and even softwares that Engineers use in the workforce such as FEA, CFD, CAD, Fusion,etc. 
There is also another purpose for this website is to show employers that I can do Software Enginnering if I wanted to get back into that and move into Front-End or Back-End but mostly Back-End.
It shows that I'm an Engineer but also I have a interest into Software and will eventaully get into it such as Robotics.
